# Genetic-Micormouse
Micromouse solves the mazes using a set of search algorithms. We can then compare to find the best optimal search algorithm using genetic algorithm.

Requirements: Python
pygame module:   pip install pygame


How to run the code:
 1) First extract the compressed file named Maze Game
 2) To run the project you have to run the python code file named 'runner.py'
 3) To experience the execution of the project, you have to:
	-Select the start position in the maze by right and left clicking anywhere in the popped up pygame window
	-Then select the button Maze in the bottom of the pygame window to generate a random maze
	-Next select the end position anywhere within the maze (same by right and left clicking)
	-To have a new position reset the maze or left and right click the current position of the start/end
	-Click on whatever algorithm you wish to use on the right-hand side of the pygame window. Then press search start
		D-DIJKSTRA
		B-BFS
		A-A*
		Q-REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
 4) To undergo the genetic evaluation of the above 4 algorithm, select start and end positions first, then select e button on the right side, then press search start. Wait for the generationS to complete. It takes about 10-12 mins and then presents you the best search algorithm in the run shell environment.
